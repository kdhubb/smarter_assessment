Who knows what he'll cook up next. Taste the bacon. Did somebody say bacon? Close your eyes and imagine trading places with your dog. This is the life, right? Run around, play, nap at will - it's a good gig. Until the Sunday morning bacon sizzle hits your turbocharged dog-nostrils at 2000 times the power of your old human self. Then it hits you smack in the face - you're not invited to the bacon festivities. Buzzkill - until Benebone comes to the rescue. This durable chew is bursting with 100% real bacon that'll mesmerize your wet dog-nose. Now put your human hat back on and do your dog a bacon-solid, Benebone-style. Because it's packed with real-deal flavor, your dog might very well chomp til the cows come home. But here's the deal - it's not edible. Pick the biggest Benebone your dog can handle and replace when you see significant wear, because eventually your powerful pup will chew this tough toy into submission. Why? Because your dog is a winner and Benebone tastes amazing. And hey, we mean it when we say Benebone is flavored with real food-grade ingredients. So if anyone in the house is allergic to nylon, peanuts, chicken, pork, or peppermint we must sadly suggest you go to find something less tantalizing. Got more questions?

Our Story: Oscar and Evelyn Overton always dreamed of owning a successful family business. An excellent cook, Evelyn's passion for baking led to the creation of her original cheesecake, a hit with everyone who tried it. By the early 1950s, while raising her two young children, David and Renee, Evelyn converted their basement into a professional bakery and supplied her original cheesecakes to the best local restaurants in Detroit. In 1972 once their children were grown, Oscar and Evelyn decided to move their business westward. Using the last of their savings, they opened a small bakery in Los Angeles to sell their original cheesecakes. They called it The Cheesecake Factory. The original cheesecake inspired their son David to create an original restaurant, unique to this day, and in 1978 he opened The Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. With little knowledge of how to run a full scale restaurant but lots of intuition into what makes a dining experience great, David set out to create a restaurant guests wouldn't soon forget - generous portions with unlimited, creative menu selection all handmade from scratch with quality ingredients served in a warm and inviting setting. There weren't any shortcuts - just delicious, fresh food. The restaurant was an immediate success! Today, The Cheesecake Factory continues to be led and inspired by the Overtons' original spirit of innovation, quality, passion and commitment to excellence. Now more people than ever enjoy The Cheesecake Factory's original food and desserts, around the world. www.thecheesecakefactory.com. Visit us at www.TheCheesecakeFactoryatHome.com.

Everybody - regardless of spiritual beliefs, birth country, race, gender, sexual orientation or color of their nail polish - is of equal worth. The reckless pursuit of profits without any consideration for the well-being of the planet and the humans that live here should be considered a crime.

It's common knowledge that consuming foods with large amounts of sugar may cause your blood sugar to spike. But, did you know other types of carbohydrates may have the same effect on blood sugar? We call this the hidden sugar effect. It's why a medium size bagel has the same impact on blood sugar as eating 8 teaspoons of sugar! (Based on glycemic load). And that's just one example - many foods loaded with simple or refined carbs can have a similar impact on blood sugar. But at Atkins, we've designed all of our delicious bars, shakes, and treats to limit simple and refined carbohydrates to help minimize the hidden sugar effect. atkins.com.
